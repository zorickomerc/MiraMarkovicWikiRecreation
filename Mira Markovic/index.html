            Mirjana "Mira" Marković (Serbian Cyrillic: Мирјана "Мира" Марковић,
            pronounced was a Serbian politician,
            academic and the wife of Yugoslav and Serbian president Slobodan Milošević.</p><br>
            <p>She was the leader of the far-left Yugoslav United Left (JUL) which governed
            in coalition with Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia in the aftermath of the Bosnian War.
            She was reported to have huge influence over her husband and was increasingly seen as the power behind the throne.
            Among her opponents, she was known as The Red Witch and the Lady Macbeth of Belgrade.</p><br>
            <p> Marković was accused of abuse of office, inciting several associates to allocate a state-owned apartment for her grandson’s
            nanny in September 2000. She was indicted in December 2002 and fled Belgrade on 23 February 2003. In June 2018, she was declared guilty in absentia
            by a court in Belgrade, and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, but the verdict was overturned on appeal in March 2019.
            Marković lived under political asylum in Russia from February 2003 until her death on 14
             April 2019 in Moscow.</p>

                   Josip Broz Tito. Her mother Vera was captured by German troops and allegedly
                    released sensitive information, under torture.[6]</p>
                     <p>She was then executed in the Banjica concentration camp by the Nazis.
